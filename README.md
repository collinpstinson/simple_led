Learning Altium essentials with a simple board design. 

I learned the basics from Fedevel by creating this two-sided board. I learned to create my own footprints, library, schematic, PCB design using vias and copper pour, and generate various files for fabrication, BOM, gerbers, pick and place, layers, drill, status report, and 3D PDF.
