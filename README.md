Learning Altium essentials with a simple board design. 

I learned the basics from Fedevel by creating this two-sided board. I learned to create my own footprints and library by referencing data sheets. PCB design utilized vias to route to the back layer and copper pour for the return path. Also learned to generate various files for fabrication, BOM, gerbers, pick and place, layers, drill, status report, and 3D PDF.
